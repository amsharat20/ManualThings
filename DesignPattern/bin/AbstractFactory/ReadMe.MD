Factory design pattern in java:   
 
 we have a single Factory class. This factory class returns different subclasses based on the input provided.
 Factory class uses if-else or switch statement to achieve this.
 
 
Abstract Factory pattern :

we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class.
 Then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class
