The decorator design pattern allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects in the same class.

Decorator design patterns allow us to add functionality to an object (not the class) at runtime, and we can apply this customized functionality to an individual object based on our requirement and choice.

Suppose we have a Christmas tree object and we want to decorate it. The decoration does not change the object itself; it’s just that in addition to the Christmas tree, we're adding some decoration items like garland, tinsel, tree-topper, bubble lights, etc
