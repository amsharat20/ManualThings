The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the SUBJECT, 
maintains a list of its dependents, called OBSERVERS, 
and notifies them automatically of any state changes, 
usually by calling one of their methods.


Ex: Youtube -- You subscribe. Any new video uploaded i get notification.
I observe the youtube channel and i get notified.(I am observing)

Channel --> subject
Subcribers --> Observers
